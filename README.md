# ML4641-Team-Project

In the group project for Machine Learning (CS 4641), we implemented both supervised (decision tree, regression) and unsupervised (clustering) models to analyze real estate datasets. 

We developed a decision tree to help users decide whether to rent a house given its features. Our regression model predicts the price of a house based on its characteristics. Through clustering, we grouped houses by similar characteristics with regard to price, helping sellers determine a suitable price range for a house. 

By leveraging Python packages such as numpy, pandas, sklearn, and TensorFlow, we conducted data preprocessing and cleaning, model training, and evaluation. Furthermore, we created visualizations of our models' results.

Through this project, we gained valuable insight into how the housing market works and consumers' tastes and preferences in housing. Understanding these insights can help people make optimal decisions regarding renting, buying, and selling properties.
