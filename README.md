# ML4641-Team-Project
Group project for CS 4641: Machine Learning

We implemented both supervised (decision tree, regression) and unsupervised (clustering) models to analyze real estate datasets. The decision tree helps users decide whether to rent a house given its features. We trained the regression model to predict the price of a house based on its characteristics. Through clustering, we grouped houses by similar characteristics with regard to price, helping sellers decide a suitable price range for a house.

In this project, we used Python packages such as numpy, pandas, sklearn, and TensorFlow. The steps we took include data preprocessing/cleaning, training and testing the models we implemented, and displaying the results.
